 * The Contact Interface (PAL) APIs
 *
 * The purpose and scope of this file is to implement CT PAL, Prototype of the CT Interface PAL
 * This module implements contact interface Api's in flash memory.
 * This module designed and can be extended to multi-process environment.
 * This module contains protocol layer abstraction Apis which will call Hardware Abstraction Apis Internally.
 * The user of this module can use these Apis for contact protocol(T=0 or T=1) Communication.
 *
 * @warning If the build Macro \ref PHFL_PARAM_CHECK is less than \ref PH_PARAM_CHECK_VERBOSE, then the input
 *                  parameters will not be checked for erroneous values in the API. In such a build configuration use
 *                  the API with caution and pass valid parameters only. Invalid parameters will likely result in
 *                  hardfaults or other failures.
